This script is used in conjunction with the RemoteDoorController script to provide remote controlled opening of doors.

This script should be set on a ProgrammingBlock on the grid with doors that you want to be able to open remotely. It will listen for signals from the RemoteDoorController and perform the appropriate actions.

**Note that the grid must have an antenna and the RemoteDoorController grid must have its own antenna and they must be in range of each other for commands to work.
